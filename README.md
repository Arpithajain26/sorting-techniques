# Sorting Techniques

This repository contains implementations of sorting algorithms in Python as part of learning **Striver’s A2Z DSA Sheet**.

📅 Today, I have learned and added the following sorting algorithms:
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**

## 📌 Sorting Algorithms Implemented

### 1️⃣ Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  
This process continues until the array becomes sorted.

**Time Complexity:**
- Worst Case: O(n²)
- Average Case: O(n²)
- Best Case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)

---

### 2️⃣ Selection Sort

Selection Sort works by dividing the array into two parts: a sorted subarray and an unsorted subarray.  
In each iteration, it selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and places it at the correct position in the sorted part.

**Time Complexity:**
- Worst Case: O(n²)
- Average Case: O(n²)
- Best Case: O(n²) (even if the array is already sorted)

## 🧠 How to Use

1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arpithajain26/sorting-techniques.git
2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder:

cd sorting-techniques
3️⃣ Run the Python files:

python bubble_sort.py
python selection_sort.py
Make sure Python is installed on your system.

📚 What I Learned
Understanding how Bubble Sort works through adjacent comparisons and swaps

Understanding how Selection Sort selects the minimum element

Time and space complexity analysis of basic sorting algorithms

Strengthened problem-solving skills using Python

🚀 Future Plans
I plan to add more sorting algorithms as I progress through the DSA sheet, such as:

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Heap Sort
